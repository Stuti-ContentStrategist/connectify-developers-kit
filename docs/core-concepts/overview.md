# 📘 Overview

The **Core Concepts** section gives you a clear understanding of how the **Connectify Developer’s Kit (CDK)** operates behind the scenes. Before diving into API endpoints or integrations, it’s important to know how the SDK handles communication, structure, and data flow.

You’ll learn how to:

* 🏗️ **Understand the SDK architecture** and its core components
* 🔄 **Follow the request–response cycle** between the SDK and Connectify’s servers
* 🧬 **Work with data models** used to structure requests and interpret responses
* ⚠️ **Handle errors effectively** to ensure stability and smooth operation

💡 **Tip:** Grasping these concepts will help you write cleaner code, debug faster, and build more efficient integrations.
