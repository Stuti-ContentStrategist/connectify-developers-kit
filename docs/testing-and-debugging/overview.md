It covers methods to **validate your setup**, **simulate real-world API scenarios**, and **resolve common issues** efficiently.

You’ll learn how to:

* 🧪 Run test scripts to verify SDK installation and API connectivity.
* ❗ Identify and troubleshoot common integration issues.
* 🕵️ Use debugging techniques to trace and resolve complex errors.
* 🎭 Mock API responses for safe, isolated testing.
