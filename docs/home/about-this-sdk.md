# ℹ️ About This SDK

This SDK provides a standardized, developer-friendly way to interact with Connectify services using clean, well-structured code.

#### 🔧 Core Design Principles

* **Simplicity:** Start coding with minimal setup.
* **Security:** Built-in OAuth 2.0 and API-key authentication.
* **Consistency:** Uniform request–response models across all supported languages.
* **Extensibility:** Easy integration with third-party systems and APIs.

#### 🧱 Architecture at a Glance

* Customize workflows without breaking core functionality
* Replace or extend modules (e.g., custom auth or logging)
* Maintain clarity in complex integrations

#### 🧰 What You Get

* Detailed API reference
