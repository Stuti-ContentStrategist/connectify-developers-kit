# 📘 Overview

The **Authentication & Security** section explains how the **Connectify Developer’s Kit (CDK)** ensures secure access to Connectify’s APIs. Every API request must be properly authenticated to protect your data, maintain access control, and ensure the integrity of your integrations.

You’ll learn how to:

* 🧭 **Understand the authentication process used by CDK**
* 🔑 **Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials for secure access**
* 🔁 **Manage and refresh tokens automatically**
* 🛡️ **Implement best practices to protect sensitive information**

By following these steps, you’ll establish a robust and secure connection between your application and the Connectify platform.

💡 **Tip:** Always complete your configuration setup before starting this section to avoid credential and token errors.
