# 📘 Overview

The **Python SDK** is part of the **Connectify Developer’s Kit (CDK)** and allows developers to integrate Connectify’s features seamlessly into Python-based applications.

It provides intuitive methods for making API calls, managing authentication, handling devices, and automating workflows — all with minimal setup.

#### ⚙️ Why Use the Python SDK?

* 🧩 Simplifies API communication using native Python methods
* 🔐 Manages authentication, token handling, and retries automatically
* ⚡ Supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations
* 🧱 Provides strong data models for clean, readable code
* 🧠 Ideal for quick scripting, automation, and backend integration

#### 📦 What You’ll Learn

This section will guide you through:

* 📦 **Installation (pip)** — Installing and setting up the SDK in your environment
* ⚙️ **Initialization** — Authenticating and initializing the SDK client
* 💬 **Example API Calls** — Making real-world Connectify API requests
* ⏳ **Async Usage** — Implementing non-blocking API operations
* 🚫 **Handling Exceptions** — Managing errors gracefully in your scripts
* 🧾 **Logging & Debugging** — Tracking requests and troubleshooting efficiently

💡 **Tip:** The Python SDK is fully compatible with Python 3.8 and above. Always ensure your virtual environment is activated before installation.
