# 📘 Overview

The **Python SDK** is part of the **Connectify Software Development Kit (SDK)** and allows developers to integrate Connectify’s features seamlessly into Python-based applications.

It provides intuitive methods for making API calls, managing authentication, handling devices, and automating workflows — all with minimal setup.

#### ⚙️ Why Use the Python SDK?

* 🧩 **Simplifies API communication** using native Python methods
* 🔐 **Manages authentication, token handling,** and retries automatically
* ⚡ **Supports both synchronous and asynchronous** operations
* 🧱 **Provides strong data models** for clean, readable code
* 🧠 Ideal for **quick scripting, automation**, and **backend integration**

#### 📘 What You’ll Learn

This section will guide you through:

* 📦 **Installing** and setting up the SDK in your environment
* ⚙️ **Authenticating** and initializing the SDK client
* 💬 **Making real-world** **Connectify API requests**
* ⏳ **Implementing** non-blocking API operations
* 🚫 **Managing errors** gracefully in your scripts
* 🧾 **Tracking requests** and troubleshooting efficiently

💡 **Tip:** The Python SDK is fully compatible with Python 3.8 and above. Always ensure your virtual environment is activated before installation.
