# 📘 Overview

The **Connectify API Reference** serves as your complete guide to understanding and using the **Connectify Software Development Kit (SDK)** APIs.

It provides detailed information about every available endpoint, its parameters, responses, and error codes — enabling developers to build, test, and optimize integrations confidently.

With the Connectify APIs, you can:

* Access and manage **devices, users, and automation rules**
* Perform **CRUD operations** via **RESTful endpoints**
* Handle **requests and responses** efficiently using supported SDK methods
* **Monitor performance** through pagination and rate limit management

💡 **Tip:** Each endpoint follows a consistent structure for easy navigation and implementation. Examples are provided for multiple programming languages wherever applicable.
